# Autism_CSF_Scripts
Preprocessing and Processing Scripts

## Getting Started
Scripts are organized in folders: analysis, preproc, auto_scripts, and freesurfer. The analysis scripts cover the comparisons in the demographics table and results section. The preproc and auto_scripts correspond to preprocessing and Auto_EACSF processing respectively. The freesurfer folder contains scripts used to process 28 Human Connectome Project subjects and obtain the test-retest reliability of FreeSurfer's longitudinal ventricular CSF output. All atlases and templates referenced are disseminated on the NITRC Downloads page for Auto_EACSF: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/auto_eacsf/. README files can be found in each folder, so please see these for additional details.

## Contact
Coding is not our primary expertise--but if you have questions concerning script usage, please contact us through our lab webpage: https://brain.byu.edu/contact. Any questions regarding Auto_EACSF should be sent to the NITRC forum page. Best of luck!
