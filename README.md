# Autism_CSF_Scripts
Preprocessing and Processing Scripts

## Getting Started
Scripts are organized in two folders: preproc and auto_scripts. These correspond to preprocessing and Auto_EACSF processing respectively. The third folder contains atlases (which are disseminated on the NITRC page for Auto_EACSF: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/auto_eacsf/). README files can be found in each folder, so please see these for additional details.

## Contact
Coding is not our primary expertise--but if you have questions concerning script usage, please contact us at mpeter55@byu.edu. Any questions regarding Auto_EACSF should be sent to the NITRC forum page.
